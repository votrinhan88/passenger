<b>Passenger Mod for GTA V</b> | v1.1 | <a href="https://github.com/votrinhan88/passenger">GitHub</a>

<b>Features</b>
Another attempt to make a Passenger mod! Existing mods are buggy/outdated so I decided to step up.
+ Press G to enter nearest vehicle as Passenger (auto warp in 5 seconds).
+ Once inside vehicle:
____+ Press G to cycle between empty seats.
____+ Now here's the <b>FUN</b> thing: <b>Press G while aiming</b> to make threaten peds in vehicle (so that they don't run away) and make driver go vroommmmm. You'll know it when you hear them <b>scream</b>.
____+ If you have a <b>>Marker</b>, the driver will drive you there. If he forgets it, <b>Press G while aiming</b> again to point that gun against his head and remind him!
+ Key are customizable via .ini
____+ Set verbose = 3 if you want more messages.

<b>Installation</b>
1. Requires the latest version of SHVDN-nightly â‰¥ v3.7.0-nightly.19.

<b>Changelog</b>
