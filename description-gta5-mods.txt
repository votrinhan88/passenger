<b>Passenger Mod for GTA V</b> | v1.0 | <a href="https://github.com/votrinhan88/passenger">GitHub</a>

<b>Features</b>
Another attempt to make a Passenger mod! Existing mods are buggy/outdated so I decided to step up,
+ Press G to enter nearest vehicle as Passenger (auto warp in 5 seconds).
+ Once inside vehicle:
____+ Press G to cycle between empty seats.
____+ Now here's the <b>FUN</b> thing: Switch to first-person, and <b>press G while aiming at the driver</b> to make him go vrooommmmm and threaten peds in vehicle (so that they don't run away).
+ Key are customizable via .ini

<b>Installation</b>
1. Requires the latest version of SHVDN-nightly â‰¥ v3.7.0-nightly.16.
2. Put `Passenger.dll` and `Passenger.pcb` in `GTA V/scripts/`.
3. The `Passenger.ini` settings file will be automatically generated after the first run.

<b>Uninstallation</b>
1. Delete `Passenger.dll` and `Passenger.pcb` in `GTA V/scripts/`.

<b>Disclaimer</b>
