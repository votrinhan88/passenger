**Passenger Mod for GTA V** | v1.0 | [gta5-mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/passenger)

### Features
Another attempt to make a Passenger mod! Existing mods are buggy/outdated so I decided to step up,
+ Press G to enter nearest vehicle as Passenger (auto warp in 5 seconds).
+ Once inside vehicle:
____+ Press G to cycle between empty seats.
____+ Now here's the **FUN** thing: Switch to first-person, and **press G while aiming at the driver** to make him go vrooommmmm and threaten peds in vehicle (so that they don't run away).
+ Key are customizable via .ini

### Installation
1. Requires the latest version of SHVDN-nightly â‰¥ v3.7.0-nightly.16.
2. Put `Passenger.dll` and `Passenger.pcb` in `GTA V/scripts/`.
3. The `Passenger.ini` settings file will be automatically generated after the first run.

### Uninstallation
1. Delete `Passenger.dll` and `Passenger.pcb` in `GTA V/scripts/`.

### Disclaimer
+ Do not upload elsewhere. Do not used for commercial, financial, or personal gain.
+ Very early version - Have only tested minimally on cars/trucks/motorbikes on highway! Do expect some bugs and tell me if so!
+ Leave comments if you have any ideas!
