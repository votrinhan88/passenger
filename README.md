**Passenger Mod for GTA V** | v1.1 | [gta5-mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/passenger)

### Features
Another attempt to make a Passenger mod! Existing mods are buggy/outdated so I decided to step up.
+ Press G to enter nearest vehicle as Passenger (auto warp in 5 seconds).
+ Once inside vehicle:
    + Press G to cycle between empty seats.
    + Now here's the **FUN** thing: **Press G while aiming** to make threaten peds in vehicle (so that they don't run away) and make driver go vroommmmm. You'll know it when you hear them **scream**.
    + If you have a **Marker**, the driver will drive you there. If he forgets it, **Press G while aiming** again to point that gun against his head and remind him!
+ Keys are customizable via .ini:
    + Set verbose = 3 if you want more messages.

### Installation
1. Requires the latest version of SHVDN-nightly â‰¥ v3.7.0-nightly.19.
2. Put `Passenger.dll`, `Passenger.pcb`, and `Passenger.ini` in `GTA V/scripts/`.
3. The `Passenger.ini` settings file will be automatically generated again if deleted.

### Changelog
+ v1.1:
    + Make Driver drive to destination if marker exists
    + Replace ped-threatening notifications with ambient screaming sounds
    + Add .ini file

### Uninstallation
1. Delete `Passenger.dll` and `Passenger.pcb` in `GTA V/scripts/`.
